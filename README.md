### Problem Statement:
With the speedfast exponential growth in the number of content creators around the world, and the social media app's algorithm to only make it easy to find and shine the popular ones;
*How do creators with a small audience find creators(with the same target audience) who would be willing to collaborating with them?*

### Solution: 
A platform that bridges the gap for creators of all popularity levels, enabling them to discover other creators eagerly awaiting an account like theirs to make contact. 
A website which helps user filter out accounts on the basis of their required niche and popularity of creators. Helps you easily connect like minded people at the similar popularity as theirs which becomes the key to mutual growth.

This would not be a market where you need to stumble upon your product or spend hours looking around for that one thing you had in mind; it's a vast and meticulously navigable domain. You know precisely how to find your perfect partnership.
